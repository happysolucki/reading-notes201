### Accounting for Screen Sizes

Not everyone that visits your website will be using the same devices. You should account for a range of screen sizes to make your site as accessible as possible. Web designers usually attempt to make webpages that are around 1000px wide. It somewhat mitigates the large variance that can occur between screen sizes. There are a couple of general approaches web devs use to account for various screen sizes. 

#### Fixed Witdth Layouts

Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements ten to given in pixels.

#### Liquid Layouts

 Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.
