# Local Storage

Local Storage is HTML5's answer to developer needs of saving large amounts of data client-side that persists beyond a page refresh and isn't transmitted to a server. Before HTML5, there weren't many options for web apps to save persistent local storage, unlike native apps that have various approaches to saving data. The only real option was cookies, but its weaknesses necessitated the creation of Local Storage. Cookies weren't enough because:

- they're included with every HTTP request, thus slowing down the webpage & sending unencrypted data over the internet
- they can only hold up to 4 KB of data, which is enough to slow down a webpage, but not enough to be terribly useful
